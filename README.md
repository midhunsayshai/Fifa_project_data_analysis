# Fifa_project_data_analysis

**Project Overview**
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the FIFA player dataset.
The goal is to understand player salary distribution and key characteristics, and visualize insights using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
The analysis includes salary-based comparisons, total salary evaluation, and understanding player preferences such as their dominant foot.

**Objectives**
The main objectives of the project are:
Plot the Top 5 Highest-Paid Players
Identify players with the highest salaries.
Visualize their names and salary amounts.
Understand salary concentration among elite players.

1. Plot the Bottom 5 Lowest-Paid Players
2. Identify players with the lowest wages.
3. Compare their earnings with respect to the dataset.
4. Visualize the lowest-paid group for contrast with top players.

**Plot the Total Salary Distribution**
1. Calculate total spend on player salaries.
2. Visualize salary distribution in the entire dataset.
3. Understand how earnings vary among players (skewness, patterns, ranges).

**Plot the Count of Preferred Foot (Left vs Right)**
1. Analyze how many players are left-footed vs right-footed.
2. Visualize the distribution using count plots or bar charts.
3. Understand foot preference trends among professional players.

**Features of the Project**
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Insights about salary patterns
* Simple and beginner-friendly code

**Tools & Libraries Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

****Visualizations Included**
1. Bar charts for top and bottom salaries.
2. Distribution plots for total salary
3. Countplot for preferred foot
4. Additional insights from summary statistics

**Conclusion**
1. This project helps understand the salary structure of FIFA players and their characteristics.
Through visualization, we can quickly find trends such as:
2. Salary inequality between top and bottom players
3. Overall salary distribution
4. Dominance of right-footed players (expected trend)
5. It provides a strong foundation for deeper football analytics work.
